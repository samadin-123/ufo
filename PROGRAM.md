## Goal

Improve the harmonic mean of operations per second across core URL manipulation functions (parseURL, stringifyParsedURL, parseQuery, stringifyQuery, joinURL, normalizeURL, withQuery, hasProtocol, cleanDoubleSlashes, withBase, withoutBase, isEqual) by at least 5% from the baseline of ~807,000 ops/sec.

## What you CAN modify

- `src/**/*.ts` — all TypeScript source files in src directory

## What you CANNOT modify

- `PROGRAM.md` — research program specification
- `PREPARE.md` — evaluation setup and trust boundary
- `.polyresearch/` — runtime directory
- `test/benchmark.mjs` — evaluation harness and scoring logic
- `test/**/*.test.ts` — test suite (must continue to pass)
- `package.json` — dependencies and build configuration
- `tsconfig.json` — TypeScript configuration

## Constraints

- All changes must pass the evaluation harness defined in PREPARE.md.
- Each experiment should be atomic and independently verifiable.
- All else being equal, simpler is better. A small improvement that adds ugly complexity is not worth keeping. Removing code and getting equal or better results is a great outcome.
- If a run crashes, use judgment: fix trivial bugs (typos, missing imports) and re-run. If the idea is fundamentally broken, skip it and move on.
- Document what you tried and what you observed in the attempt summary.

## Strategy hints

- Read the full codebase before your first experiment. Understand what you are working with.
- Start with the lowest-hanging fruit.
- Measure before and after every change.
- Read results.tsv to learn from history. Do not repeat approaches that already failed.
- If an approach does not show improvement after reasonable effort, release and move on.
- Try combining ideas from previous near-misses.
- If you are stuck, try something more radical. Re-read the source for new angles.
